This repository comprises a web application with a React.js frontend and a Node.js backend. The final output window is visually represented in the provided image. The green-highlighted area in the images is dynamically served from the backend, accessible at [SoldierPage_Backend](https://soldierpage-backend.onrender.com/). The following features are implemented:

- **BattleField 4-Soldier Page:** A dedicated page showcasing detailed information about BattleField 4 soldiers.

- **Help Page:** An informational page providing assistance or guidance for users.

- **Not Found Page:** A page to handle routes that do not match any implemented pages, ensuring a seamless user experience even in case of unexpected routes.

The backend interacts with the frontend through one or more API calls, facilitating the fetching of data from the server to the frontend components. This project is designed to offer a comprehensive and responsive user interface for exploring BattleField 4 soldier profiles.
